Gator
=====

Gator is a small SOCKS4, SOCKS5 proxyï¼Œclone from https://github.com/eXeC64/gator, but fix some bug, add support SOCKS4. It just support connect command of two proxy protocol.

It was developed as an experiment in go, and with some love it could grow
into something useful, such as a HTTP filtering system (adblocking perhaps)
or if some kind of SSL auth were implemented, a privacy helper.

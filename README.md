Gator
=====

Gator is a small SOCKS4, SOCKS5 proxy, it does not implement the full RFC (1928)
but it works for no-auth basic usage.

It was developed as an experiment in go, and with some love it could grow
into something useful, such as a HTTP filtering system (adblocking perhaps)
or if some kind of SSL auth were implemented, a privacy helper.
